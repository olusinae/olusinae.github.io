                            <p>On <b>Tuesday 18th of July</b>,
                                we got introduced to the client – Elise Allen, and requirements. 
                                <br>We joined desired groups and discussed extensively on how to go about creating the spinner app. Also, we 
                                started with setting up communication means, version control for the project and Trello (to keep track of 
                                activities).

                            <p>The client, Elise, described what she wanted and when she needed it (in 2 weeks’ time). We decided on 
                                going home to think individually, about what platform would be best until the next meeting.</p>

                            <p>
                                Elise wanted; 
                                <br> &#9755; An app that will have advert feature that brings income for her each time someone views the ad.
                                <br> &#9755; A decision spinner with options/answers to questions.
                                <br> &#9755; A button to start the spinner.
                                <br> &#9755; Feature that allows users to add and edit choice set questions and options.
                                <br> &#9755; Options to change interface (skin colour, SFX etc).
                                <br> &#9755; Have space for ads.
                                <br> &#9755; Get user’s name at the start.
                                <br> &#9755; Have main activity page.
                                <br> &#9755; Have history of user’s set choice options. 
                            </p>
                            </p>

                        <br><br>
                        <p>On <b>Wednesday 19th of July </b>, we couldn’t meet up but had our conversation online through Facebook. After deciding on making the project a Web App and, I found a resource online for the spinner project. I uploaded the file
                            on Trello for a review from my team members. <br> The resource was accepted and we opted to meet in class on Thursday 20th of July for further planning.
                        </p>

                        <br><br>

                        <p>On <b>Thursday 20th of July</b>, we met in class to further discuss the next step. Although Grayson was unavailable for the class, Mark and I had our first scrum. During the scrum, we asked each other the questions;
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            &#9755; What have you done regarding the project since the last meeting? <br> &#9755; What are you planning to do?<br> &#9755; What obstacles prevents your efficiency?<br>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <br> The scrum master for that day (Mark) would then put measures in place to assist the person struggling in carrying out the given task. Afterwards, Mark allocated a set of tasks to everyone. <br> Also, we had our communication
                            going on Facebook and Trello.
                        </p>

                        <br><br>
                        <p>On <b>Friday 21st of July</b>, we all concluded our individual tasks towards having a prototype ready for our client’s viewing Tuesday. However, Grayson suggested a different user interface for the Web App, which seemed great to
                            Mark and I. The new UI was uploaded to gitbucket and made ready for client’s viewing on Tuesday 25th of July.
                            <br>We held our conversations of Facebook because we all had different schedules.
                            <br>The cards of tasks to be done were updated on Trello, which leaves us with a very few tasks left to be carried out after initial client’s viewing.
                        </p>

                        <br><br>
                        <p>
                            On <b>Tuesday 25th of July</b>, we presented the prototype to the client (Elise) who was satisfied with the current state of the application. We assured her of other features, such as ability of user to set choice questions and options, that will be implemented
                            before final presentation of the application. 
                            <p>In addition, we had a short meeting to review individual progresses and to figure out how far we have gone with the project.</p>
                        </p>

                        <br><br>
                        <p>
                            On <b>Thursday 27th of July </b>, we had a setback with implementing the feature that allows the user to set choice questions and options. This was due to the JavaScript framework, d3.js, that we used. It occurred to us that creating a database for the user’s set choice questions and linking it to the app, would be difficult to implement within the remaining timeframe.
                            <p>However, we decided to research ways of working around it, which led to a minor success. We created an external JavaScript file that collects information from the user, and stores it in a flat file. The only setback with this was the inability to pull data from the flat file into the external JavaScript, and passing it into the HTML + JavaScript file that holds the spinner.</p>
                            <p>Hence, we fixed a time for the following Monday for a meeting to review possible solutions, that individual persons have researched for fixing this problem.</p>

                        </p>

                       <br><br>   

                        <p> 
                            On <b>Monday 31st of July</b>, we met in the department’s common room at 3pm. It appeared from individual persons’ report that implementing the feature through the initial means, within the remaining timeframe would be impossible. 
                                <p>So, we decided on collecting information from the user using JavaScript without storing the information, but still providing the user with the option of setting choice questions and options.</P>
                        <p>This idea seemed great to us all and we made our final changes to the application. We uploaded the files to Kate (department’s server) to make it accessible online for the client.</p>
                        </p>

                       <br><br>

                        <p>
                        On <b>Tuesday</b> 1st of August, we had our final presentation which was a success as the client was pleased with the outcome. 
                        <p>However, we were unfortunately unable to implement the advertisement feature that the client wanted initially.</p>
